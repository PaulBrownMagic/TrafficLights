# Traffic Lights

traffic_light.py contains base class to setup a pygame window as a traffic light.

demo.py shows how a pupil may interact with traffic_light.py to program the traffic light sequence. It deliberately
mirrors the Raspberry Pi GPIO implementation as a practice tool/ emergency replacement for PiStop or PiBrella or other
traffic light GPIO based hardware.
